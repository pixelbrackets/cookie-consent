Cookie Consent
==============

üç™ Standalone script to display a cookie consent to comply with EU cookie law.

*Yet another cookie consent bar‚Ä¶ Whyyyyy‚ùì‚ùì*

‚Ä¶Well, most of the popular existing solutions have issues like‚Ä¶

- require loading the JavaScript trough a CDN ‚Üí which may track visitors and 
  therefore signifies a privacy issue
- require a JavaScript framework like jQuery ‚Üí which may not exist if the 
  current site only adds a cookie because of one tracking tool
- add advertisments
- add trackers
- are hard to modify
- set inline styles ‚Üí dont allow to separate scripts & styles, which makes it 
  harder to add custom stylesheets
- have to many styles or no styles at all
- hardcode labels/text in the JavaScript ‚Üí limit translations & text changes
- are too big/complex (mostly because styles, scripts & labels are mixed and the 
  options to change all of them are more complex then the cookie logic itself)

Goals of this library:

- KISS
- Separate JavaScript logic, styles and markup
- Allow to copy/integrate a simple, single JavaScript (no CDN, no framework)
- Allow to change text/labels as desired
- Add basic fallbacks (eg. styles), which may be overwritten
- Dont make any external request
